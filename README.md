# PyBer_Analytics
## Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to determine data by "City Type", specifically data regarding total weekly fare for each city type. The data will be used to determine the differences by city type and how this data may be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 
## Results:
### Urban:
The results show there are a greater number of total rides, drivers, and fares, but a lower average of fare per ride and fare per driver. 
### Rural:
The resuls show that there are the least number of total rides, drivers, and fares in rural areas, but the highest average fare per ride and fare per driver. 
### Suburban:
Meanwhile, the results show that suburban areas have fewer total drivers and rides, but the total fare is closer to the Urban values; $19,356.33 and $39,854.38, respectively. With the lower number of drivers but higher fares, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is more than Rural areas, but marignally less than Urban areas. 
## Summary:
Given the above;
- While Rural drivers on average have higher fares, the data must be viewed in light of the number of drivers compared to the number of drivers in Suburban and Urban areas. 
- As there are far less drivers in Rural areas and an abundance of drivers in Urban areas, Urban drivers will need more rides in order to meet their Rural drivers' average fare
- Should Suburban drivers increase there is an expectation that the data will more closely mirror Urban drivers' average fare will likley decrease.
